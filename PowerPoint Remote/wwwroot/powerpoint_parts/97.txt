O Lord, Your Son spoke the truth before His enemies even as they sought to trap Him in His words and deliver Him up to death. Rescue Your people from fear, and grant them courage to confess the truth, assuring them of deliverance in time of trouble. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. O Lord, You gave Your Son to be rejected by sinners, that we may be welcomed into Your kingdom. Preserve Your Church in this life won by Christ, crucified and risen. Give faithfulness to the preaching of Your Word and the administration of Your Sacraments, and let Your people receive these gifts with penitence and faith. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. O Lord, salvation belongs to You. Your blessing be on Your people. Endow parents with every good gift to teach their children Your ways, that they may live in the confidence of Your grace and salvation. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. O Lord, You shield us and lift our heads. Provide for us civil authorities who discourage evil / and encourage good, but keep us all ever mindful / that our hope / is in You. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. O Lord, show Your compassion to all who suffer in our midst [_____________ and]. Remind them continually of Your benefits, forgive all their iniquities, heal all their diseases and crown them with steadfast love. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. O Lord, St. Paul counted all things as rubbish in order that he might gain Christ. Give us repentant hearts, that we would abandon all confidence in our flesh and so receive Your Son’s body and blood for the forgiveness of our sins. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.
