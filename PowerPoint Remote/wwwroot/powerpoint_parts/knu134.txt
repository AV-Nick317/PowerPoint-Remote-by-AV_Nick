O Lord, since Your Son has gone up with a shout and the sound of a trumpet, ascended in triumph and seated at Your right hand, so open our lips to sing praises to our King, rejoicing and living in the truth of His victory for us. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. Father of glory, pour out the Holy Spirit upon the Church, that she may proclaim to the ends of the earth the good news of what Your Son has accomplished in His life, death, resurrection and ascension. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. Almighty God, since Your Son will shatter kings when He executes judgment on the nations, keep all our leaders from acting in ways that will earn them His wrath. Bless them with wisdom to govern us in accord with Your righteous ways. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. Merciful Lord, Your Son has ascended to sit at Your right hand until You make all enemies His footstool. Fix our eyes on Him, ruling in the midst of His enemies, that we may have no fear of them but abide in His peace. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. Heavenly Father, You have seated Christ at Your right hand for our deliverance. Remember those who are afflicted with illness and injury [including _____________]. Give them health and strength according to Your will. Sustain them in faith, knowing that, for Jesus’ sake, You will raise them in glory on the Last Day. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer. Blessed Lord, You are the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. From You all things come and to You all things must return. Receive our thanks for the saints of every generation whose fidelity has commended the faith to us. Make us also faithful in preserving the hope to which we have been called. Bring us at last to that day when all things are under Your feet, Your name is above all names, and we shall rest in Your presence forevermore. Lord, in Your mercy, hear our prayer.
