Almighty God, our heavenly Father,Your mercies are new every morning;and through we deserve only punishment,	You receive us as Your children	and provide for all our needs of body and soul.Grant that we may heartily acknowledge Your merciful goodness,	give thanks for all Your benefits,	and serve You in willing obedience;through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord,who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit,one God, now and forever.
